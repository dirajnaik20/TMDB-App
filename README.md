## Overview

TMDB-APP is an Android app developed during my Udemy course by Anushka Madusudan. It utilizes the power of the TMDB API to fetch detailed information about movies, TV shows, and trending artists. Built with MVVM architecture, Kotlin as the primary programming language, ViewModel, LiveData, Room for local storage, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for networking, and Glide for seamless image loading, this app offers a smooth and intuitive user experience.
